<b>This is my 30 apps in 30 days project. I am using React JS.</b>

What is this project?

Each day I will attempt to make one React webapp.

I used these resources to get me started with React:
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s JavaScript exercises 
- [exercism](http://exercism.io/)
- [React Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/)


The project is hosted at: https://th1rty.herokuapp.com/

Wish me luck! 🍀


🎨 For the artwork, I use:
- my own watercolour paintings
- Piskel Sprite Editor to create the digital art and gifs: http://www.piskelapp.com/

<b>Day 1: Collect Pocky 😋</b>


<b>Day 2: Escape the Labyrinth/Save Toby 👶</b>


<b>Day 3: Dice 🎲</b>
- Used every-dice npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/every-dice


<b>Day 4: Pepper 🤖</b>

<b>Day 5: Good Egg 🥚</b>
